# Cheese Crave E-Commerce Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio project created to showcase our technical skills and collaboration capabilities.

## Project Overview

Our cheese e-commerce website is a visually appealing and fully functional platform designed to showcase our team's development skills. The website will include a variety of features, such as product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication.


### Project Goals

- Develop a full-stack e-commerce web application: Create an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing user interface using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, backed by a robust REST API built with Java and Spring Boot.
- Implement a comprehensive data management system: Design a MySQL database schema to store and manage product, user, and order data and develop efficient CRUD operations for seamless interactions between the front and back end.
- Enhance user experience and functionality: Incorporate features such as secure user authentication, dynamic search and filtering, shopping cart functionality, and a streamlined checkout process to provide an enjoyable shopping experience for customers.
- Optimize performance and maintainability: Ensure cross-browser compatibility, fast loading times, and adherence to web development best practices while integrating analytics and monitoring to gather insights for continuous improvement.
